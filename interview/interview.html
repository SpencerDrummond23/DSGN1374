		<div class="q">
<h2>1. When you think of graphic design, what comes to mind and why?</h2> 
</div>


<div class="a">
<p>When I think of graphic design what comes to mind is the idea of form and functionality. I think of this because form and functionality are what graphic design is, making something look good but it also functions properly as well.</p>



<div class="q">
<h2>3. What aspect of the graphic design knowledge stayed with you the most and why?</h2>
</div>


<div class="a">
<p>The one aspect of graphic design that has stayed with me the most is the idea of Notan for some reason. When ever I am starting a project my first thought is about Notan because when I was taught about Notan I realized that graphic design isn't about just putting things together until they work. Graphic design is about using skills and knowledge of graphic design tools and principles that you learn to create a great design.</p>



<div class="q">
<h2>4. When navigating to a new website, what are some of the traits that initially capture your attention and provoke your continued interest in the previewed content?</h2>
</div>


<div class="a">
<p>When first seeing a website the things that attract my eye and make me want to stay are the color scheme, the easy at which I can navigate the website and how they deal with presenting new information whether through pop-ups or banners. For the color scheme I personally like it simple and with toned down colors, I don't like neon and having a million colors on one page is confusing. For the ease at which I can navigate a website it comes down to how they manage the different sections o f information and how the information is organized. Personally, I hate pop-ups that I have to exit to be able to navigate the website they are very annoying and especially when they continuously pop-up. I prefer banners that either appear at the top or the sides of a website so they can stay out of my way.</p>




<div class="q">
<h2>5. What focus of design do you consider to be the most effective and why?</h2>
</div>


<div class="a">
<p>I think one aspect of design that is the most effective is the use of grids in your work. Grids allow a design to be as chaotic as it wants well still looking put together and easy to read. Grids are a great way to bring a design to the next level and they can be used with anything.</p>



<div class="q">
<h2>6. How do you see graphic design progressing in the future both physically and virtually?</h2>
</div>


<div class="a">
<p>In the future I believe physically graphic design will be more Eco-friendly and that one of the main concerns when designing something is how it will affect the environment around it. Virtually, I believe that graphic design will relatively stay the same with maybe the addition of new design ideas and tools.</p>
